  Notes


(Ultralight Beam Chance the rapper thought process) <br>

I’m gonna make it
“You’re never gonna make it”
Making its not the plan  
it’s being successful but I’m guessin  
You won’t understand my confession  
But at the same time that’s also a blessin
Cause you won’t be able to end my profession
Everybody lookin for lethal projection 
But I know I got my lethal protection 
Cause while things may hurt me
Words can build up and break down society 
Nukes can destroy a city
But the gospel of word destroy em overseas
I aint no Mkai Phiper I’m just Piper Pete
Even better I’m the saint of sinners, youll see
King Solomon compared me to a wisecracker 
Speaking of comparisons who let in the jester

-(Written to No Bells by MCMC)
Make lolli pop when I give her the sucker
Hockey stick dick now give it a pucker
Clam lips on my dick why don’t you give it a shucker 
You spit more hot air in than a sauna
Drop the soap in Infront of Obama
Gassed up in Jeans made of lama
Yo girl got saliva made of lava
Cause now it hurts when I pee
Release a mixtape cause its free aye
Sleepin dirty like I got mud on my PJ’s
Blowing leaves into the street cause she gave me a bj
Say aye all you want, you’ll never be the alpha, bet
Legally change my name to chad or Chet
Rap money to pay the billa 
Go NYC sightseeing with J Dilla
Call me a wafer cause my flavor vanilla
Bars so basic they remind me of the color Manila
Got more bitches than a pimpin John Travolta
Call em up on my designer Motorola
And then invite her over to my sofa
If you pull up I raise the bar higher
Just like you girl yo bitch ass a liar


-8/29/21
They makin it rain Dolla bills signed love
But this ain’t a paid advertisement for the ones up and above

-9/2/21
Written to Piano Beat MCMC
At the present 
My presence is a present
No longer a peasant
I represent the NC residents 
I resonate with my role models proof
Cause my goal is to be the greatest in the booth
The realest among the youth
Fans wear me like Duluth
Double talk my way through the truth
You say I’m less but add Ruth
Cause baby the ceiling is the roof

-Written to Growing Pains 9/2/21
Always a want never a need with you people
Lip twitches spoken words religiously sharper than a steeple
One of the sins called greed makes you feel mighty deceitful 
But I’m still Shoveling your seedy bullshit by the heap full 
Peaceful is how they find me, with the threat of being Fearful
The boy grew up and now he a hydrated by the tearful

Its not about you getting a honey, 
it’s about honeys getting you, 
Life is a bitch but it can be a honey too
Life is just change for the many of for the few

Release a mixtape cause its free babe
Sleepin dirty like I got mud on my PJ’s
Blowin leaves into the street cause she gave me a BJ
Travis Scott astroworld sponsors JFK 

9/3/21
Eat a champion for breakfast 
Ballisticly cannibalistic when I hear your confessions
Spit mistakes correctly in every session
Cause the lyrics give it a lesson
While the beat gives it a blessing
Perfection, why don’t you ask who I’m askin
Never toss a wack line to the trash bin
It can be re imagined to a different fashion 
And if you think rhymes have a ration
Then obviously this shit aint your passion
Baskin, in my success I shit 50s and spit 100s
I aint done drugs
I don’t need weed to toast your buns
I just spit heat like tatooine for fun


I aint perfect on the mic
But at least I spit what I write
I literally preach what I practice
I aint no influencer, this ain’t no tactic
Its just me and my boy MCMC in the attic
And you know when I flow it’s above the static

9/4/21
Linebacker stiff arm your bitch post
Spike your head on my fence post
Ladies say they got an inch at most
Saints got more than an inch to boast
Coast clear cause the beach private
Ain’t about gettin into that bitch privates
I don’t mean to pry when she visits
But I promised god no wine in the dishes
Sorry baby you ain’t mine it’s just business
Im not your genie take it off your wishlist 
Yall just pocket watches with wristbands
Watch out or ill be with girl on the kiss cam
Moist on yo crotch cause you pissed man
Didnt even have to put a pill in the ham
Cause your boy speak the illa 
Spilla Billa Killa to Killa Vanilla Nilla 
Fill a rhyme line with more meanings,
Than sides on a stop sign
Like I got double gum rappers small and yellow like pissants
This is the trouble you fear when you hear my lyrical skills enhance
Rise from the rubble rebel yell and chant
Fuck money get bitches man, wise words straight from a true brotha Sam 



9/6/21
Girl I’ll wear you on my wrist like a fit bitch
Sowin money like it’s stitch fix
Luckily I’m my own personal critic
I know you smart but lets not get into statistics 
Cause statistically the listen to me

9/7/21
Preach what I practice
When I Practice what I preach
Survey the wreckage
Satirically hang a wreath  
Open the saltine package 
cause you gotta let a cracker breath


I’ll hand you some money if you can foot the bill

9/8/21:
See I dissect, prospect, and come correct for any text that I wreck
The ass follows me like shrek 
I’ll foot the bill if you hand the check
And you know I’m as high as Sedlacek
 
 9/9/21
I pick the the littlest in the litter
And flush it down the shitter 
See that taste in yo mouth is bitter
Cause you realized my lines are better
And my rhymes solidify like butter
Minor upgrades like blinds into shutters
Major updates like fives into hundreds 
may leave yo dreads to the rudder 
I’m the fittest among you roadside litter
I’m a winner, this the one they elect
See I dissect, prospect, and come correct for any text that I wreck
The ass follows me like I’m shrek 
I’ll foot the bill if you hand the check
And you know I’m as high as Sedlacek



-Pop

Who you trying to keep out pops
Are you gonna live out the cops
Don’t you go hide in the crops
I just want to lick my chops

Ayo Ayo Ayo Ayo 

When you squeezed, And I popped
And I’m pissed, Cause you chopped
Off my dick, like Iraq
You a bitch, Do not talk
I just tik, And I tok
On the mic, imma clock
Covid sick, I got the glock
Flow I pick, it just a mock

Ayo Ayo Ayo Ayo

Pick Objective Principles 
Spit it fast for a second
That was a note for my decibels
I’m going for a record
That was a goal for you untouchables
Eat shit forced like a cardboard lunchable
Put on my resume I’m fuckable
And if you think I’m not
Well suck on my testicle 

Ayo Ayo Ayo Ayo

Pop and Lock
Pull up in designer crocs
Shit a fat rock
I suggest sir hung paos takeout
And eat a raw cock
Wear socks as a glove
On my dick which I love
Cryptic? Naw read above
My mind is now stuck on a dove

Ayo Ayo Ayo Ayo

I’m all about poppin off
Homies hair lookin like farquad 
Landscape a bitch then lay down the sod
Ask the middle East about their god
If you want some gas
Eat out a chick I like my eggs hatched 
No opinion just facts
Rappers say they unmatched 
Blowin out more hot air than a hair dryer
Movin up cause they want me for hire 
Lyrics burn rubber I never tire
I spit rap scripture in verses you admire

Ayo Ayo Ayo Ayo

Aint talking pop like soda
Or pop like the sound in yo motor
Not that music with a bad odor
Don’t confuse PLP with POP
Talkin just the shit I see
Trying to stand out in a littered sea
Just practicing my literacy
Using rhymes to hurt litter I see
Secrets I’m lock and key
But key smiths let masons free
Excuse me gotta go pee
Michael Jackson Hee-Hee

Ayo Ayo Ayo Ayo


9/10/21

I execute the violence 
No moment of silence 
Cute baby tantrum tyrants
Hands rinsed and hence forth 
Annual war on July 4th



I respect dead president’s last regard
I don’t rap cause it’s easy But because it’s hard

9/11/21
I will succeed
Got my eyes off the screen
Open my window of dreams
Just wanting to be seen
Bust down a door with my feet
Cause hard work pays more than a 
shitty tweet

9/22/21
I dont die
But if I did die
I would be dead 
spreading out the dread like feds delegating meds
Color they uniform blue just to spit lead
and leave em red, now the witness purple
cause all they friends dead imma shed
some store knowledge on these feeders of the bottom
Dont be a bitch and we wont have a problem
All these younger bitches be rottin in hell
cause you know we never sell we never bail we never make a mistake
our only failure is heartbreak

Got more bars than pixels on a 90 inch
spread like sars ill put an itch in your stitches
swipe my card just to summon the leeches
enjoy the beach and reach for the women with plastic peaches
abundance of skills exceeding the niches to fill
downhill battle cause I start on top
make the attic floors rattle cut the cattle cho chop
master chef in this bitch and you know I got the sauce
dirtier than false teeth without floss
never take a loss
even when I flirt with the barista
lines more descriptive than when Im fuckin a moaner and her name lisa
More proverbs and phrases than the poes motha
your brotha more nerdy than ferb and phineas
I serve as a thrust, my lyrical herbs better than lust
Im the only saint you can trust when your thrown on the curb and bust

This is a 3 part song with 5 head verse 
Now I got some words for the people trying to drive me to a herse
Im not the first and I wont be the last
But im from the future and yo ass belong in the past
Thats my present, blastin out you STD's like im fauci
Utopia in my mind, Dystopia in my world
Bars have no metal value cause they pearled
Write with pen cause I never screw up
Only mistake was not writing enough
Dont smoke cause you piggies need the huff and puff
Never a failure but yall startin up like wuph
Cuff you into a contract like im ratty cable
Got more balls than a pool table
and you know im horneier for money than a foreign label

--

Forgive the devil

Forgive the devil for lettin me peddle these pebbles 
into different levels of living
We straight off of significant beings
its the carolina blue collar king
call it keen how im destroying these being
Queen patience at my side and we always face our fears
never like a deer in headlights
and dont beleive it when you hear im stuck all night at a red light
Never catch me in a ist fight cause im always pivoting
like an airstream illget silver but im still riveting
fighting to the top like Muhammed Ali
Cause I float like the smoke comin off the mic
Sting like a hornet angry in flight
Takes all the might in the world to be the saint of sinners
Let me paint a picture
I have a way with words but words will have their way with me
Put on a utopian smile just to lose a shred of humanity
Stay perfect to a T but in the dark youll never see
The construction of my free verse book of rhymes
Chime up when required but released in the quiet
Bite off the average but know I can chew more
Control the flow but release the savage when adequite at my core
(^ Some weird ass shit damn)

You have 1000's of hoes I have 2000's women
Spawns of shadies rabies and a lack of attention
And did I metion that just like your babies 
you have a lack of retention
For my pension I get royalties bitches
And Im only interested in fuckin wenches
Did you catch that hook line and rhyme you fishes
Your already shit, why dont you cum and piss
While I giver her the french you squirting frenches
Your all dogs but a cockerspaniel got more cock than you bitches
Im with it pass me an opportunity I wont miss it
Dont smoke weed but I act like a misfit
Never piss a fit, but you act like a pipsqueak
When I make your girls widows
Peak while im in bed with her ill make you reek with eek
Ask why you cryin, cause there is no shame to be seen
Forgive but never forget the devil in me

Confessions of a Common Mind

Hoes in the back, bitches in the front
She like it low in the sack whil im fuckin her cunt
She creamin fack fack fack, while im yellin fuck
Girl what the hell is that when I noticed the lump
Are you burnin, "Me so horny"
Besides that whats inside
Well I sprayed some pesticide up there to commit suicide
But I guess that wasnt so wise now was it clyde?
Bitch you aint no Bonnie, your real names clarence
And clarence parents have a real good marriage
Hold the fuck up, Women, more like woah its a man
Not a fan, need a sex change, my homie can hook you up
This shit corrupt, a dumpster fire, Unoriginal pirates lying about
Whose writing these ghost stories, Press Quarries, Weightless Worries
Painting your hurries as if you were the sun
Havin fun on fire, but even stars expire

Bitch Imma del
When you say a del do you mean the singer?
Or are you selling a dell with delete key
Maybe an ikeal label for a ladel
See I dissect, prospect, and come correct for any text I wreck
Impeccable how my writing utensil is the equivalent of an razor without an eraser
I suggest sir gung paos takeout and eat a raw cock
If you knock ill lock, Im gods rock but not like dwayne
Fame is far but the pain is premptive
Primitive cause your songs are ape shit
Cuffs are our bracelets
Cant find no one that isnt basic
That or im friends with their track records
Listeners skip you like checkers
Tippin cowards and flippin birds
Im certain those girls like your broken piston
You purposely drop the soap in prison
Listen, at the heart I poetically curse these slivers of trees
My graphite sheath, Half life theif
And you know ill rip your dick and cheek 
rap with my Toungue and teeth
If your a veteran ill pay respects and hang a wreath

No Ads

No Ads its a simple fad
A gimik, straght pur limirik
Sick of product placement, yall need to stick with art
Its all spend money live less walmart
Or go from A-Z on amazon an fill up your cart
Stop goin crazy postal like your part fedex
Start thinkin put windex in yo bitch put yo greif in a ditch
Even in the kitchen
Dont start packin heat like you hotpockets
Looks like you need balls ill direct you to dicks
get a quick fix to put you in the autozone
Dont bone with the man, you can find me on instagram
Its a sham almost paranormal
Panera in my corner, but I need to eat
Look to arbys cause they have the meats
Have a fleet of foot wear but im always ready
Cause I can finally ford a chevy
Wear khakis, like the look of Levis
Im on planet fitness and im gettin hella heavy
In control like dick cheney
Wear nike for Victory
Only have 50 so I have to be thrifty
Born shifty but act nifty
If things get shitty well ill
Turn your shaftand sack into a jack daniels cocktail
Seem like a frail pal vanilla woohoo
But ill make you shit eggs like you was limu emu
Feelin like Keanu cause its
Icy hot Saint Jess on the mix bitch
Sowin money like its motherfuckin Stich Fix

Rap Scripture:

Come hither and quiver as I recite rap scripture
All dressed in leather, god appeared
He said If thy trip thou shall fall to the nether

Shave you sheep demonstrate my sheer power
I butcher the beef cowards
and have the nerve to send flowers
Southern sinner dictionary speaks for itself
Shelf life is not a concern, and if you think it is
you better fuckin learn
Burn through my rhymes like
Cadence, Genius, Patience, Penis, Audience, Arenas, Radience, Regence
Never a distraction from my passion
Your reaction is based on my actions
I rise from one faction to another and im askin
When do I win the mask and costume competition?
Sure you can go fast,but you have no friction
Writing my rap pictionary, military speak when I curse the gooks and fairys
Leave you embaressed cherry red, Make sure your still alive
When your buried assumed dead

Never a need, always a want with you people
Lip twitches spoken words relegiously sharper than a steeple
Repent for my lethal liberal speel
Peel bak your pupil, sou you can look and listen
Sew shut your lips, so you can stop kissin my ass
Feel the massage of my message

Call me king solomon cause I was born a wisecracker
If I give you a compliment its greek nectar
Cut off the people who say sizes matters
Line backer stiff arm the wine packers
who put first world worries into autotuned music
Move it or prove your worth
A lazy mans curse when cursing becomes a crutch
Stickin my dick into a shit fucky monkey
A muck, a ruckus, good luck chuck
Expand your horizons like Bizons Verizon Hidenburg Biden Tightend
I could go on but I produce rap not a rhyme book
Not a crook but I have the key
Glue your cracks shut so you cant shit on me
Destroy you before the que cause I cause real time latency
Heard across the country cause of my radioactivity
Adversaries think im dead but theyll be payin the late fee

At the present 
My presence is a present
No longer a peasant
I represent the NC residents 
I resonate with my role models proof
Cause my goal is to be the greatest in the booth
The realest among the youth
Fans wear me like Duluth
Double talk my way through the truth
You say I’m less but add Ruth
Cause baby the ceiling is the roof



Nothing dont rhyme with orange
But if you put a beige orangutang named lauren eating pouridge 
Then you got some pretty good wordage
